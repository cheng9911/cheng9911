👋 Hi, I'm Cheng!
I’m a robotics researcher and developer focused on intelligent manipulation, skill learning, and human-robot interaction. I build systems that combine real-time control with learning-based decision-making to make robots more adaptive and capable.

🧠 Research & Development Interests
🤖 Robot Skill Learning
Designing and learning reusable robotic skills from demonstration, teleoperation, and reinforcement learning. Building scalable skill libraries and high-level planners for complex tasks.

🧭 Motion Planning & Control
Developing Cartesian and joint-space planning frameworks, integrating with real-time controllers (e.g., Ruckig, libfranka).

🖼️ Perception + Language
Using vision-language models (VLMs) for grounding, task recognition, and semantic skill selection.

🧩 Multi-Robot Systems
Exploring coordinated control and shared autonomy across multi-arm or mobile robot platforms.

⚙️ Tools & Frameworks
Languages: Python, C++

Frameworks: ROS 2/Mujoco/Vrep, Rocos-app, Ruckig, PyTorch, OpenCV

VLMs & Learning: BLIP-2, ACT, Diffusion Policy, Transformers

Platforms: Franka Panda, Jetson, Realsense, Ubuntu Linux
